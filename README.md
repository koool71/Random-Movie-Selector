# Random-Movie-Selector
Little project I made for my girlfriend and I to help us choose a movie from our list :)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create a movie list in a .txt file with each listed movie beginning on a new line
2. Save file in the same folder as compiled code
3. Change source code to open file named the same name as your .txt movie list file
4. Complile .cpp file (c++11 using g++. Command: g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -O1 movieSelect.cpp -o movieSelect) 
5. Run movieSelect.o and follow the instructions on the main menu! 


WORK IN PROGRESS:
1. Hope to make it so you will not need to edit code to use different lists. Want to allow user to create their own list which in turn will create a new .txt file in a seperate folder where all movie lists are stored. Then I want the program to discover all .txt files in the folder and list out which list the user would like to use. 
  a). Possibly convert this functionality in the future to allow for genre sorting and other filtering functionality 
2. Want to turn this program into an executable for easy sharing 
3. Want to attach code to a basic UI for easy usability 
  a). Possibly convert into a web app once desktop app is functional???
